This notebook provides means to calculate the mass of the up- and down- quark using finite energy sum rules. 
It is intended as a supplement to the paper: Dominguez , Mes, Schilcher, 'Up- and Down- Quark Masses from QCD Sum Rules', (2018).
Please cite this paper if using any part of the code in this mathematica notebook.
